## Acknowledgments
Our group and especially our lead programmer would like to express their \
gratitude to the following people:
1. Our seminarist Виталий Завадский AKA [Xenoner](https://github.com/xenoner1506) for being \
   the nicest computer science teacher
2. Author of pygame_gui package [MyreMalar](https://github.com/MyreMylar) for creating such \
   a great package for GUI design
3. Russion pop-singers [MAYBE BABY](https://vk.com/artist/maybebaby) and [Dora](https://vk.com/artist/dora) for being the only \
   reason for the lead programmer to do the project instead of their\
